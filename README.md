## Summary
With election day approaching, I conducted a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of the recent debate between the two presidential candidates. Using Python-based NLP tools, I examined the content of the debate to uncover insights into their language.
During the analysis, I discovered some interesting findings about each candidateâ€™s speech. Here are a few insights I'd like to share:

1. How many words were used in the debate?
   
   During the debate, Kamala Harris spoke a total of 32,846 words, while Donald Trump used 43,217 words. Combined, the two candidates contributed a total of 76,063 words throughout the debate.

2. Sentiment Analysis

   The data frame below highlights an interesting observation: Kamala Harris exhibited a lower overall negative sentiment in her debate responses compared to Donald Trump, who displayed a higher level of negative sentiment. However, both candidates largely maintained a neutral tone throughout the debate.
